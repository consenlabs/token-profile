    "en": "The global population is entering an aging stage. The number and proportion of aging population in almost every country in the world are increasing. Population aging is likely to become one of the most important social trends in the 21st century, which affects almost all social fields, including labor and financial markets, demand for goods and services such as housing, transportation and social security, family structure and intergenerational relations.

Older persons are increasingly seen as contributors to development, and their ability to take action to improve the situation of themselves and their communities should be integrated into policies and programmes at all levels. In the coming decades, many countries will face government pressure related to public health systems, pensions and social security in order to adapt to the growing elderly population.

The global population aged 65 and over is growing faster than the young group. In order to cope with the trend of population aging, we united with governments at all levels at home and abroad, medical institutions, community service centers, housekeeping service centers and elderly care institutions to establish a smart medical big data elderly care system platform, AI disease diagnosis and analysis system, vital signs monitoring system, physical examination system, chronic disease rehabilitation center and gene testing to solve the last mile of medical treatment for the elderly, Catering, training, entertainment, funeral and other services.",
    "zh": "全球人口正步入老龄化阶段。世界上几乎每个国家的老龄人口数量和比例正在增加。人口老龄化有可能成为21世纪最重要的社会趋势之一，几乎所有社会领域都受其影响，包括劳动力和金融市场、对住房、交通和社会保障等商品和服务的需求、家庭结构和代际关系。

       老年人日益被视为发展的贡献者，他们为改善自身及其社区状况而采取行动的能力应被纳入各级政策和方案。未来几十年，为适应与日俱增的老年人口，许多国家将可面临与公共保健体系、养老金和社会保障相关的政府压力。
       全球65岁及以上人口的增长速度超过年轻群体。为应对人口老龄化的趋势，我们联合国内外各级政府、医疗机构，社区服务中心，家政服务中心，养老机构，建立智慧医疗大数据养老系统平台，AI病症诊断分析系统，生命体征监控系统、健康体检系统，慢病康复中心，基因检测等解决老年人最后一公里的就医，餐饮，培训、娱乐，丧葬等服务。"
