        "en": "YDapp is a game community formed by blockchain gamers, formerly known as YIHONGYUAN, an Ethereum game community. Currently it is the top 1 Guild of Evolution.Land. With its unique insight into blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, the team has invested in some quality EOS game projects and has made quite big profits. After a phase of exploring, based on our optimistic estimates of the EOS and its ecology, many projects are still in their infancy and have plenty room for progress, while an experienced team is still missing for community maintenance. Hence, we decided to set up YDapp.io website and some related communities to provide players with the latest game information and to provide promotions and community operating services for the project parties. The team includes Dapp developers, cryptocurrency measurement practitioners, former Okamoto China Content Operating Chief and community KOL, who are all senior Dapp gamers."
