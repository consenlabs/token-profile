        "en": "HorusPay is a decentralized Global Pay Portal using blockchain technology which allows global entities to exchange private, encrypted, secured data for international payroll vendors .Global payment is a common trouble issue for global enterprise. The current system is complex and flawed because it’s plagued by obscure laws and regulations, inefficient communications, and middlemen who strive to simplify global payroll, but complicate it further. When a company outsources payroll to a global payroll provider or middleman, enterprise often experiences four common problems：1）Low quality vendors with high fees；2）Inefficient, error-prone communications；3）Slow international transactions 4) Security concerns. Many global payroll providers have been hacked. Horuspay is devoted to solve problems above."
