  "overview":{
        "en": "OGT, Origin Chain Pass, is a decentralized digital asset issued on the basis of Ethereum and issued by the Origin Chain Foundation.
As the consensus proof between the main chain of origin and the parallel chain, it is the proof of the amount of work for users to participate in the construction of parallel chain ecology by making consensus decision, maintaining iteration and other behavior mining methods on the origin chain.Based on the origin chain, it can be used for recording, confirming, registering, supervising and verifying, parallel linking into, etc., to realize the flow of value, and it can be used in multiple scenarios within the parallel chain ecology on the origin chain. Ecological users pledge a certain proportion of OGT, and will enjoy the unique membership rights in the parallel chain ecology on the origin chain, whose rights are enabled by the OGT value of each parallel chain according to the current application scenario.
Consensus and transparency are the core concepts of blockchain. When OGT participates in parallel chain ecological construction and community governance on the origin chain, OGT applies the same proportion in parallel chain ecology on the origin chain according to the result of user consensus voting, so that every user can participate in the construction and development of the platform to jointly build the origin chain ecology.",
        "zh": "OGT为Origin chain token 的简称暨起源链通证，是基于以太坊发行的去中心化数字资产，由Origin chain基金会发行。
OGT作为Origin chain主链与平行链之间的共识凭证，是用户通过在Origin chain上进行共识决策、维护迭代等行为挖矿方式以及参与Origin chain平行链生态建设的工作量证明。基于Origin chain可用于记录，确权，登记，监管校验，平行链接入等，以实现价值的流转，在Origin chain平行链生态内进行多场景使用。生态用户质押一定比例的 OGT ,将享受Origin chain平行链生态内独有的会员权益，其权益由各平行链根据当下应用场景进行OGT价值赋能。
共识和透明是区块链的核心理念，OGT在参与Origin chain平行链生态建设与社区治理时，OGT依据用户共识表决结果，等比例应用于Origin chain平行链生态之中，让每一位用户参与平台的建设和发展，共建Origin chain生态。"
