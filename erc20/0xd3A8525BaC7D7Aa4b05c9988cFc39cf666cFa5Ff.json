  "overview":{
    "en": "CYCION is a token issued based on a combination of blockchain and Internet securities trading. The founding team came from Robin Hood, Saxo Bank, and members of the Ethereum developer community. In the pre-Internet era, stock traders traded by telephone with brokers, defined as a 1.0 trading model. After the spread of the Internet, traders began trading on more advanced and edited Internet platforms, such as Robin Hood, which can be defined as a 2.0 trading model. However, both the 1.0 transaction model and the advanced 2.0 transaction model have not changed some facts :1. Securities trading cannot be transparent, open and fair. 2. Securities traders always make contributions to the platform in one direction and cannot enjoy the profits of the platform 3. Traders cannot participate in the community building of the platform. The popularization and application of blockchain technology can solve the problems between the two very well. CYCION is a win-win trading model for both traders and platforms. We have designed a decentralized public ledger and a consensus algorithm where members play three roles, [miner], [sponsor], and [trader], to contribute to community building and receive CYCION rewards. We define it as a 3.0 transaction model",
    "zh": "CYCION是基于区块链和互联网证券交易相结合而发行的代币。创始团队分别来自于罗宾汉、盛宝银行以及以太坊开发者社区成员。在没有互联网的年代，证券交易者都是通过电话联繫经纪人交易，可以定义为1.0交易模式。在互联网普及之后，交易者开始通过更先进编辑的互联网平台交易，比如罗宾汉，可以定义为2.0交易模式。但，不管是1.0交易模式还是先进的2.0交易模式，始终都无法改变一些事实:1.证券交易无法透明、公开、公正。2.证券交易者始终是单方向的爲平台做贡献，无法享受平台的利润回报3.交易者无法参与到平台的社区建设。区块链技术的普及应用，能非常好的解决两者之间的问题。CYCION是交易者与平台双方共赢的一种交易模式。我们设计了一种去中心化的公共帐本和一套共识演算法，会员将扮演三种角色，[矿工]、[引荐者]、[交易者]，为社区建设带来贡献和获得CYCION回报。我们定义为3.0交易模式"
