    "en": " IMO Token is the platform token of IMO ecosystem, which enables the project to obtain investment in stages through continuous limited private sales. The project will continue to be privately funded with development progress and stage results. The general private sale periods are divided into 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or even longer. IMO uses a variety of advanced mathematical models to control the private sales and market at different stages. During the private sale period, the exchange and investors will observe the development of the project and decide whether to invest or not. Invest or withdraw. Phased batch-to-batch investments will greatly reduce investor’s risk. At the same time, it also gives encouragement and benign supervision to the project team, so that the project can develop healthily and ultimately return to investors. The IMO platform will strictly screen and check the quality of each project and take certain measures to ensure the interests of investors.",
