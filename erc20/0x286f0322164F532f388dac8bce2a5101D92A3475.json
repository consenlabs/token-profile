  "overview":{
        "en": "We are establishing a new ecosystem in gene industry with users as the core, gene sequencing companies, gene product and service providers and project parties. We use distributed storage and encryption technology to solve the gene data privacy and security issues. We and other third-party genetic testing companies can develop a variety of gene applications on the platform for nutritional diet, exercise, skin care, health management, drug development, parental recognition, and scientific research, allowing individuals to obtain the benefits of digital assets by Token stimulus while accelerating the exploration of genetic technology. With the rapid development of genome sequencing technology, the cost of personal genome sequencing is rapidly decreasing, and personal genome data will become an important digital asset for everyone. After an individual has ownership of personal genomic data and is free and easy to control personal genomic data, economic and social value will be realized for individuals and businesses.",
