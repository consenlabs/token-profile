        "en": "BATC is an encrypted digital asset issued based on the Bats DAO mechanism. Bats DAO is the consensus mechanism of the black bat community. The Black Bats DAO autonomous organization has open procedures and financial transparency, and is controlled by token holders. There is no absolute center, so the price is not affected by the central organization. In other words, the price of BATC is only controlled by the market and is no longer controlled by a certain person or institution. The only source of BATC will only organize individuals to obtain power (that is, computing power) by destroying contributions in a market environment with transparent publicity and full supervision. Different computing power will produce corresponding BATC.",
        "zh": "BATC是一种基于Bats DAO机制所发行的加密数字资产，Bats DAO是黑蝙蝠社区的共识机制。Black Bats DAO自治组织程序公开、财务透明，由代币持有者控制，没有绝对中心，因此价格不受中心机构的影响。也就是说BATC价格只受市场管控，不再是受到某个人或机构进行操控。BATC的唯一来源只会在公示透明、全员监管的市场环境下组织个人通过销毁贡献获得权力（即算力），不同的算力将产出相应的BATC。"
