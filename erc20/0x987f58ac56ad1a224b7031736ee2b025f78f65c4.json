        "en": "K.ZONE Ecology will have a variety of ecological applications, ecological applications and KZ token is highly linked, such as game applications in the entertainment ecosystem, KZ will be used as a bargaining chip, with the ecological application gradually landing, will produce huge demand for KZ which will inevitably lead to the formation of KZ in the market, which will lead to an increase in KZ value. All ecological applications have their own profit model. With a large number of ecological applications, huge profits will be generated. These profits will be distributed to K.ZONE Eco users and developers (KZ holders). The purchase and dividend forms give back to the holders of KZ, which will also increase the value of KZ.",
        "zh": "K.ZONE生态将会有多种生态应用，生态应用与 KZ 通证高度挂钩，比如娱乐生态中的游戏应用，KZ 将会作为游戏的筹码，随着生态应用逐步落地，会对KZ产生巨大的需求，必然在市场上形成KZ供不应求导致KZ价格的上涨。所有的生态应用都有其盈利模式，随着大量生态应用落地将会产生巨额的盈利，这些盈利将会全部分配给K.ZONE 生态的用户和开发者（KZ 持有者），以回购以及分红的形式回馈 KZ 的持有者，这同样会使得KZ价值升高推动价格上涨。"
