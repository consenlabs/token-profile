        "en": "ABC.Chain is a smart contract to create a global ecological traceable species traceability detection shared ecology, aiming to solve the problem of traceability detection in the green rare species industry through blockchain technology.ABC.Chain will first be applied in the traditional agarwood industry to solve the painful spots of the agarwood industry's counterfeit goods and promote the healthy development of the agarwood industry.In the future, ABC.Chain will become a public chain, and more green and rare species will be included in ABC.Chain's traceability detection ecosystem solve the problems of green rare species industry.ABC.Chain also pioneered the block-chain digital assets combined with the physical delivery of the bottom-up exchange, which will makehigher value-added attributes forABC digital assets.The object used as the bottom mark has chosen to be an extremely precious chess agarwood since ancient times.Because it is a scarce species in itself, and it is very versatile (medicinal market, perfume market, collectible market).The contributors in this ecology can exchange one gram (approximately RMB 1,000) for the cultivation of chess and agarwood in the global ABC.Chain ecology for every 100 ABCs held.The smart contract has a very large investment value-added attribute and guarantees the healthy development of the ABC.Chain community.",
