        "en": "PLATO, game tokens, whose circulation is 100 million, can be used to exchange rare NFT props and basic production resources (processing plants, etc.) or upgradeto unlock more content. Users can obtain PLATO through market transactions. The more PLATO they hold, the higher level of identity in the game.
