          "en":"Digital money payment has increasingly become an indispensable means of payment in daily life. However, traditional payment methods represented by traditional bank credit cards and transfers, and new means of payment represented by PayPal, Alipay and other Internet payment tools can not solve the low transaction efficiency brought by the centralized organization. Under the traditional technology logic, the problem of centralized organization can not be avoided. To solve these problems, G3A, the sponsor of this project, has developed a global multi-payment coin project based on block chain technology (hereinafter referred to as GMPC). The project makes use of the de-centralization characteristics of block chain to build a de-centralized international payment network to provide a safe and convenient legal currency for entity transactions. Receiving channels provide both buyers and sellers with proper consumer protection for transactions, as well as more business application interfaces for block chains.",
          "zh":"数字化货币支付已经越来越成为日常生活中必不 可少的支付手段，但以传统的银行信用卡、转账为代 表的传统支付手段，和以PayPal、支付宝等互联网支 付工具为代表的新型支付手段，都无法解决中心化组 织带来的交易效率低下、安全隐患等问题，在传统的 技术逻辑下，中心化组织的问题无法避免。针对这些问题，本项目发起方G3区块链产业联盟 (G3A)开发了基于区块链技术的全球多支付硬币项 目(以下简称 GMPC)，项目利用区块链的去中心化 特征，打造一个去中心化的国际支付网络，为实体交 易提供安全和便利的法定货币收款渠道，为买卖双方 提供交易应有的消费保护，也为商家提供更多的区块 链商业应用接口。"
