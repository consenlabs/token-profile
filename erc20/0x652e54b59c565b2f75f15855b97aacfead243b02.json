        "en": "Environmental pollution has become one of the three major social problems in today's world, along with the global atmospheric pollution is increasingly serious, intelligent air purifier sales rise year by year, in intelligent purifier market goods quality good and bad are intermingled, fast update rate, and the intelligent level of Internet of things application under these problems, such as differences in AIRC and headed by cloud research several purifier air purification coalition of enterprises, mainly to solve the indoor air environment, more than two-thirds of the time in indoor, indoor air environment is good, can largely reduce the incidence of disease, AIRC for each negative oxygen ion purifier,Use block chain technology to record all the equipment of large data, scientific custom home air purification project, using the intelligent mobile terminal of the count, realize data sharing, to provide fresh air capacity each device size to calculate the rate, airc reward, and hence profits i.e. airc appliances operating mode to be able to produce.",
        "zh": "环境污染已经成为当今世界性的三大社会问题之一，随着全球大气污染的日益严重，智能空气净化器的销量逐年攀升，针对智能净化器市场商品质量良莠不齐、更新换代速率快、以及物联网应用下的智能化水平差异等这些问题，AIRC与以云研为首的多家净化器企业组成空气净化联盟，主要解决室内空气环境，人有三分之二以上的时间都在室内，室内空气环境优良了，可很大程度上降低疾病的发生率，AIRC为每一台负氧离子净化器，运用区块链技术记录所有设备的大数据，科学定制家庭空气净化计划，利用移动终端的智能算力，实现数据共享，以每台设备提供新鲜空气容量大小来获得算率，奖励airc，并由此获得收益即AIRC家电运营模式得以产生。"
