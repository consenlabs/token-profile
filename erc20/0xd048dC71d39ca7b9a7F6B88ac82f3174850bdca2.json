The Reiter chain has an innovative double-layer consensus mechanism and a trustme consensus algorithm. Using this algorithm, a number of super nodes are selected periodically, and their data units are granted the notarization right. According to them, effective notarization units will be issued to obtain token rewards. Reiter chain focuses on building a simple and easy-to-use decentralized digital token underlying blockchain business value chain, develops the three laws of data value theoretical system and the three party model mechanism, based on the existing public chain platform.","zh": "瑞特链【Reiter chain】 针对现有区块链普遍存在的交易拥堵、交易费高、交易确认时间长等问题，以“极轻、极速、极趣”为目标，构建世界领先的支持挖矿的 DAG 公有链，支持海量并发交易且交易确认更快。瑞特链【Reiter chain】 具有创新的双层共识机制和 TrustME 共识算法，利用该算法周期性地选出若干超级节点，赋予它们数据单元的公证权，并会根据它们发出有效的公证单元获得 Coinbase 奖励。瑞特链【Reiter chain】聚焦于打造简单易用的去中心化数字通证底层区块链业务价值链，发展了“数据价值三定律”理论体系和“三方模式”机制，基于现有公有链平台 "	},"email": "lingbiwang@foxmail.com","website": "http://RV.CX","state": "NORMAL","published_on": "2019-8-01","whitepaper": "http://RV.CX/22.pdf","initial_price": {"USD": "$0.002USD"	},"links": {"website": "http://RV.CX"	}}
